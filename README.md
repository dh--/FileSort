# FileSort

Final project for Stanford University's 'Code In Place' online
learning course.

FileSort is a simple utility script, with large sets of files in an
unsorted/unorganized folder. Initially created to handle large folders
of just photos taken over many months/years (eg, most peoples personal
devices).

Generally the use case is for when a User is taking those photos/files
off a device, set of memory cards, from a Download folder/etc, and then
wanting to put those sorted files, on a backup hard drive, or some other
media use case.

## Usage
Can be started from comment line as 'python3 file_sort.py' ; the script
itself will prompt the User for information, but at any given time the
User has the option to enter "Q" or "q" to quit.
